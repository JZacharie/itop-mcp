# iTop MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating with iTop ITSM (IT Service Management) systems. This server provides AI assistants with the ability to interact with iTop through its REST API, enabling operations like ticket management, CI (Configuration Item) management, and more.

## üöÄ Features

The iTop MCP server provides the following tools:

**üß† Smart Query Processor V2 (New Enhanced Version):**
- **smart_query_v2**: Revolutionary natural language query processor with class-specific intelligence
  - **Automatic Class Detection**: Intelligently detects target iTop class from natural language
  - **12+ Specialized Handlers**: Dedicated processors for UserRequest, Ticket, Change, Incident, Problem, Server, PC, VirtualMachine, NetworkDevice, Person, Team, Organization
  - **Advanced Query Features**: Grouping, filtering, SLA analysis, deadline tracking, and statistical breakdowns
  - **Smart Field Mapping**: User-friendly field aliases automatically mapped to iTop schema
  - **Fuzzy Matching**: Intelligent name matching for servers, people, and other entities
  - **Real-time Schema Discovery**: Uses `*+` fields for automatic field detection
  - **Enhanced Formatting**: Class-specific output with icons, detailed/summary modes, and grouped results

**Core iTop Operations:**
- **list_operations**: List all available iTop REST API operations
- **smart_query_v2**: Process natural language queries with intelligent class detection and specialized handlers

**Legacy Support (Deprecated):**
- Note: Previous versions included additional tools (get_objects, create_object, update_object, delete_object, apply_stimulus, get_related_objects, check_credentials) which have been streamlined in favor of the more powerful smart_query_v2 approach

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the server
uv run main.py
```

### Connecting to Claude Desktop

#### Option 1: Using PyPI Installation

To use this server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "itop": {
      "command": "itop-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ITOP_BASE_URL": "https://your-itop-instance.com",
        "ITOP_USER": "your_username",
        "ITOP_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Using Source Installation

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "itop": {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": [
            "run",
            "--directory",
            "/path/to/itop-mcp",
            "itop-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
            "ITOP_BASE_URL": "https://your-itop-instance.com",
            "ITOP_USER": "your_username",
            "ITOP_PASSWORD": "your_password",
            "ITOP_VERSION": "1.3"
        }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: This works because we've configured `itop-mcp` as an entry point in `pyproject.toml`. You need to run this from the project directory where `pyproject.toml` is located, or uv needs to be able to find the project.
```

### Example Operations

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant to perform operations like:

**Basic Operations:**
- "List all open user requests in iTop"
- "Create a new incident ticket for server downtime"
- "Find all CIs related to the mail server"
- "Update the priority of ticket #123 to high"
- "Resolve ticket #456 with resolution details"

**Enhanced Queries:**
- "Get the latest 5 tickets created today"
- "Show me all tickets assigned to John Smith"
- "Find all tickets reported by Jane Doe"
- "Get detailed information for ticket R-000123"
- "List organizations containing 'Tech' in their name"

**Smart Ticket Creation:**
- "Create a new user request for printer issues reported by John from IT Department"

**AI-Powered Smart Queries:**
- "Get me PC count"
- "Give me status-based stats for the PCs"
- "Get me active tickets generated by PC-wise"
- "Change requests completed vs not completed on time"
- "Tickets closed vs not closed on time based on SLA"
- "List all servers in the production environment"
- "Show me all virtual machines running"

## iTop Class Examples

Common iTop classes you can work with:

- **UserRequest**: User requests/tickets
- **Incident**: Incident tickets
- **Person**: Users and contacts
- **Organization**: Organizations/companies
- **Server**: Server configuration items
- **Application**: Application configuration items
- **Service**: IT services
- **Contract**: Contracts and SLAs

## Advanced Features (Updated July 2025)

This server now supports advanced, AI-powered natural language queries and smart schema discovery. Key features include:

- **Smart Query Processor**: Use natural language to ask for any iTop data (e.g., "Show all virtual machines running", "List all servers in production", "Tickets closed vs not closed on time based on SLA").
- **Automatic Class & Field Detection**: The server dynamically discovers iTop classes and fields, so you don't need to hardcode field names.
- **Flexible Output**: Results can be formatted as tables, summaries, JSON, or detailed views.
- **SLA & Time Analysis**: Supports queries about SLA compliance, overdue tickets, and on-time completion.
- **Multi-Query Comparison**: Easily compare stats (e.g., closed vs not closed, completed on time vs not on time).
- **Relationship & Grouping**: Group results by status, organization, or any field, and link related objects (e.g., network devices with locations).
- **Extensible Tools**: Add new tools by decorating async functions with `@mcp.tool()`.

### Example Smart Queries

- "Get me PC count"
- "Give me status-based stats for the PCs"
- "Get me active tickets generated by PC-wise"
- "Change requests completed vs not completed on time"
- "Tickets closed vs not closed on time based on SLA"
- "List all servers in the production environment"
- "Show me all virtual machines running"

### How it Works

- The main server logic is in `main.py`.
- Uses a class taxonomy and dynamic schema discovery to map natural language to iTop REST API queries.
- Handles errors gracefully and provides suggestions if a query returns no results.
- Supports both simple and complex queries, including grouping, filtering, and comparisons.

---

## Security Notes

- Always use HTTPS for your iTop instance in production
- Store credentials securely (use environment variables, not hardcoded values)
- The user account should have minimal necessary permissions
- Test operations in a development environment first
- Use simulation mode for delete operations until you're confident

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication errors**: Ensure your user has the "REST Services User" profile in iTop
2. **Connection errors**: Verify the ITOP_BASE_URL is correct and accessible
3. **Permission errors**: Check that the user has appropriate rights on the objects you're trying to access

### Testing the Connection

Use the `check_credentials` tool to verify your configuration:

```python
# The server will automatically test credentials on startup
# You can also ask the AI assistant: "Check my iTop credentials"
```

## Development

To extend the server:

1. Add new tools by creating functions decorated with `@mcp.tool()`
2. Follow the iTop REST API documentation for available operations
3. Handle errors gracefully and provide informative messages
4. Test thoroughly in a development environment
5. Use the smart query processor for rapid prototyping and testing of new query types
